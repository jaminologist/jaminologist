# Jaminologist 👋

Yo, welcome to the page. Name's Benjamin Bryant.

I'm a London-Based, Software Engineer, Speaker and Organizer of [London Gophers](https://www.meetup.com/londongophers/) and started my professional career back in 2018. I specialize mainly in Go and have skills in public speaking. 

Currently I'm a freelance developer advocate 💻, looking to expand further into #devrel 🔭. 

Why? Check out my reasoning in my [first blog post](https://www.jaminologist.com/the-road-to-advocacy-or-how-to-effectively-manage-your-quarter-life-crisis/) or even better, check out the entire site [(Jaminologist.com)](https://www.jaminologist.com/) to get an idea of my writing style and content. 

If you're interested in my personality this talk [Go 3 Months In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr4o5XdPxOs) is always worth a gander. (Spoilers, it might get dangerously entertaining.
