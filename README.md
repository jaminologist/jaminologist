# Jaminologist 👋

Yo, welcome to the page. Name's Benjamin Bryant.

I'm a London-Based, Software Engineer, Speaker and Organizer of [London Gophers](https://www.meetup.com/londongophers/) and started my professional career back in 2018. I specialize mainly in Go and have skills in public speaking. 

If you're interested in my personality this talk [Go 3 Months In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr4o5XdPxOs) is always worth a gander. (Spoilers, it might get dangerously entertaining.
